## 🏁 Overview

**nt-pits-app** is a **self-awareness tool** designed as a **pit stop for your nervous system**.  

Just like race cars pause in the pits to **check fuel, tires, and engine** before returning to the track, this tool helps users **pause, check essentials, and reset** before continuing their day.  

It’s built for **neurodivergent users** and anyone who wants a **quick, calm check-in** with their body and environment.  

> “Pause. Check. Adjust. Continue.”

## 🛠 How It Works — The Three Steps

### 1️⃣ Bare Necessities

- Sleep ✅  
- Hunger & Thirst ✅  
- Pain & Temperature ✅  
- Energy & Basic Overstimulation ✅  

> First, make sure the **foundation is solid**. If these aren’t checked, nothing else matters.  

---

### 2️⃣ Sensory State 

- **Internal Sensations:** tightness, heaviness, buzzing, numbness  
- **External Factors:** sound, light, smell, touch, visual clutter  

> This is your **body and environment communicating**. Lets you notice tension before it builds up.  

---

### 3️⃣ Emotional Layer (Optional) — Feedback

- Gentle, rule-based suggestions  
- Accept, ignore, or skip  
- Optional layer — **not required to proceed**  

> Emotions here are **informative, not mandatory**. The priority is keeping the system functional.

## Why this tool matters ?

- Prevents overwhelm before it escalates  
- Focuses on **actions & needs** first, emotions second  
- Neutral, non-judgmental approach  
- Helps **neurodivergent users track internal and external triggers**  
- Quick, actionable, **takes 1–2 minutes**  

---

## 🎨 Design & User Experience

- Calm, soft interface with **friendly colors**  
- Step-by-step flow: Bare Necessities → Sensory → Emotional → Result  
- Intuitive sliders, chips, and toggles  
- Optional dark/light mode for comfort  
- Neutral metaphors keep focus on **function over emotion**

## 📊 Result & History

After each pit stop, the app provides:

- **Current state** — internal + external sensations  
- **Priority needs** — actionable items to check
- **Optional emotional suggestions** — soft guidance  
- **History** — review past check-ins and notice patterns
